Clutter-GTK - GTK+ Integration library for Clutter

Clutter-GTK is a library providing facilities to integrate Clutter into GTK+
applications. It provides a GTK+ widget, GtkClutterEmbed, for embedding the
default ClutterStage into any GtkContainer.

Because of limitations inside Clutter, it is only possible to embed a single
ClutterStage.

Requirements:

  Clutter >= 0.8.0 (X11 backend) or >= 0.8.0 (Win32 backend)
  GTK+ >= 2.12
