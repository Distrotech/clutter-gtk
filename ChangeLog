	* clutter-gtk/gtk-clutter-embed.c:
	(clutter_container_iface_init): Make GtkClutterEmbed implement
	ClutterContainer, and proxy all virtual functions to the
	embedded Stage.

	to the GtkClutterEmbed widget to test the Container interface
	implementation.

	enumeration.

	* examples/gtk-clutter-multistage.c:

	now window resizing works.  The stage doesn't get refreshed
	immediately (resize the window), though, and there's still
